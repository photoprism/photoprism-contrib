# Batch Rename Scripts

## Fix Extension of JPEG Files Matching the `*.HEIC` Pattern

The [heic2jpg.sh](heic2jpg.sh) script changes the file extension of all JPEG images that incorrectly match the `*.HEIC` file name pattern from `.HEIC` to `.JPG`:

```bash
./heic2jpg.sh
```

The script will scans the current directory and all subdirectories.
